## Activities

**Concerts:** We produce and curate performances in two programs: soirées (Friday night) and matinées (Sunday morning).  
**Education:** We offer advanced programs in vocality, body disciplines, and related theories, delivered by a dynamic team of [professionals](people).  
**Research:** We conduct interdisciplinary studies bridging art, science, and technology in a yearly [research program](research) that explores vocality, somatics, sound, music(ology), and live arts at large.

## Aims

- Facilitate dialogue between artists and audiences across genres and styles
- Provide high-quality teaching and open up learning opportunities for people of all ages and abilities, especially in the field of vocality and the lived body
- Provide a framework for researchers, artists, teachers, and practitioners across various disciplines related to voice, somatics, and live arts
- Create a platform for the dissemination of academic research and artistic practice, through music releases, scholarly publications, and online resources
- Promote the well-being and psychophysical development of people through creativity, beauty, coevolution, and lifelong learning
- Collaborate with public and private institutions, both formal and informal, large and small, to develop projects on the territory

CRIV is committed to democratic participation, inclusion, diversity, and sustainability. Through our integrated approach, we strive to fill a gap in the Italian cultural landscape and become an international reference point for voice research.

## Live space

At the heart of CRIV is a venue for rehearsal, performance, and gathering. The space is warm in cold seasons, cool in warm seasons, and meets hygiene standards. It features a state-of-the-art 22-channel [sound system](#) enabling innovative projects in music, sound art, and audiovisual productions. The live space aims to serve as a nexus for audiences, artists, and researchers, fostering cultural exchange, artistic innovation, and revitalization.

Volunteering at CRIV can be a rewarding experience. It offers a chance to support live arts while gaining insight into event management. You'll likely meet people who share your interests and potentially form new connections. The experience can be valuable for personal growth and may look good on a CV. While volunteering involves giving your time and effort, it also provides unique access to performances and the satisfaction of contributing to your local scene. Whether you're looking to gain experience, give back to Bologna, or simply immerse yourself in performance, volunteering here can be a worthwhile endeavor. Your skills and abilities will be greatly appreciated as you help CRIV build a better community.
