CRIV is an initiative of [**Associazione per la Voce e il Corpo**](/colophon#organization). Located on [**Via Zamboni 72, Bologna**](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Via+Zamboni,+72,+40126+Bologna+BO), the Center's activities blend live shows, foundational and advanced training, and interdisciplinary research across art, science and technology.

**Friday**: 6:30 pm - 9:30 pm

## Activities


**Concerts:** We produce and curate performances in two programs: [**Soirées** (Friday nights)](/concerts) and [**Matinées** (Sunday mornings)](/concerts).  


**Education:** We offer advanced programs in vocality, body disciplines, and related theories, delivered by a dynamic team of [professionals](people).  


**Research:** We conduct interdisciplinary studies bridging art, science, and technology in a yearly [research program](research) that explores vocality, somatics, sound, music(ology), and live arts at large.

## Aims

- Facilitate dialogue between artists and audiences across genres and styles.
- Provide high-quality teaching and open up learning opportunities for people of all ages and abilities.
- Provide a framework for researchers, artists, teachers, and practitioners across various disciplines related to voice, somatics, and live arts.
- Create a platform for the dissemination of academic and artistic research and practice, through releases, publications, and online resources.
- Promote the well-being and psychophysical development of people through creativity, beauty, coevolution, and lifelong learning.
- Collaborate with public and private institutions, both formal and informal, large and small, to develop projects on the territory and abroad.

CRIV is committed to democratic participation, inclusion, diversity, and sustainability. Through our integrated approach, we strive to fill a gap in the Italian cultural landscape and become a reference point for voice research.

## Live space

At the heart of CRIV is a venue for rehearsal, performance, and gathering. The space is warm in cold seasons, cool in warm seasons, and meets hygiene standards. Featuring a state-of-the-art [**sound system**](/sound-system), the venue aims to serve as a nexus for audiences, artists, and researchers, catalyzing exchange, innovation, and revitalization.

## Atelier for practice

Their insights span practical, theoretical, ethical, and creative considerations, helping shape our work in relation to pressing social and cultural challenges at local and global levels.
