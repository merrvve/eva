At the heart of CRIV's live space is a 22-channel sound system that allows for true immersive sound, enabling experimental projects in music, sound art, audiovisual works, and cinema productions. On this page, you can find technical information, guidance on how to design and propose projects, and details on how to rent the space for both in-house and external productions.
