An overview of the center's voices, arranged alphabetically.

<br />

##### Agnese Banti
Sound artist, musician and overtone singer, originally from a valley of northern Tuscany and roomer in different places of the Mediterranean area, she is actually based in Bologna, working with sound in music, performances, installations and audiovisuals.

With a colourful path of studies (in humanities, design and communication, electronic music and sound design) and a multidirectional interest in sound and music, her activity has always been gravitating around many points of attraction: such as choral music, soundscape studies, traditional folk music repertoires, space composition and the collaborative dimension of making music. One of the things that fascinated her the most in recent years is the research made around a sound installation project on frog voices and ancient ruins that she realised between the Electronic Music School of Bologna and the Ionian University of Corfu for her master’s degree.

She collaborates with Tempo Reale, the esteemed centre for musical research, production and education in Florence founded by Luciano Berio and she works on overtones singing projects with the Italian composer Roberto Laneri. She’s the creator of the intimate music project The Songbook and the co-founder of the electronic music collective born in the Conservatory of Bologna (2018-2021). Recently she collaborated with the choreographer Marta Bellu in “I versi delle mani” and she attended Malagola, the School of vocality and international centre for voice studies based in Ravenna.

In 2023, thanks to the support for artistic research from FONDO – Network for Emerging Creativity, she dedicated herself to the project “Speaking cables, choreographic device for voice, cables and loudspeakers”, in collaboration with the sound designer and computer musician Andrea Trona.
Her works have been performed in Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, the UK and the US. She collects music tapes and spinning tops in order to “play” them all.

##### Jacopo Cenni
Born in 1995, Jacopo Cenni is a composer and live performer. The relationship with technology is a crucial point of his artistic activity: through Computer Music and CAC techniques, Cenni creates organic and immersive sound constructs.

His research on the gestural dimension in the practice of live electronics, carried out at the Conservatory of Trento, culminated in the sound theater work HUNT (2022), which debuted at Biennale Musica 2022 and with which he graduated in Electronic Music with the highest honors. More recently, he has been specifically interested in the relationship between choreography and music, taking part in multidisciplinary projects in contexts such as the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence (FR) and the GRADUS residency of the Reggio Parma Festival (IT).

His works have been presented in events such as La Biennale di Venezia (IT), Glasgow Science Center (UK), Festival Accademia Chigiana (IT), ZiMMT (DE), Fondazione Luigi Nono (IT), and others.

##### Emanuela Sforza
A woman and artist originally from Serra de' Conti and adopted by Bologna, Emanuela Sforza has always carried within her an inexhaustible passion for photography, which she develops in a completely personal journey since, in the second half of the 1970s, she discovers the allure of dance, which will become one of the fundamental points of her research.

By observing and studying the construction of ballet, the theatrical space, the play of light and shadow, Sforza captures the moment in which sinuous bodies move, focusing particularly on the expression of the human being and portraying them in their environment, to know, understand, and appropriate, and then return to us, their inner emotionality, in a play characterized by exceptional contrasts of black and white.

Sforza's artistic research starts from dance and then turns her gaze to the theater, enters the studios of artists, and focuses on portraits of working women. Her photographs are exclusively black and white shots that she personally develops, spending hours and hours in the darkroom, until the soul of the image evolves as she herself desires. The artist has to her credit over a hundred exhibitions of national and international importance, awards, prizes, and publications.
