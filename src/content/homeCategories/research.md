CRIV is a platform for transformative ideas and practices. The [research program](/research) aims to enable collaborative projects and knowledge sharing through seminars, conferences, and publications. Bringing together theorists, artists, and critics, the research [community](/people) explores topics at the intersection of voice studies, somatics, music/sound, and critical thinking.
