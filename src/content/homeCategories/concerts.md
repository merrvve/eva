CRIV hosts two music programs: [**Soirées**](/concerts) (Friday nights) and [**Matinées**](/concerts) (Sunday mornings). Performances range from electronic avant-garde to early music, embracing both vocal and instrumental territories, and detours into other live arts complement the season. The Center supports [**artists**](/people) in creating, performing, and disseminating, bridging international and local scenes.
