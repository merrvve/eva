CRIV hosts two music programs in a specialized sound space: [**Soirées**](/concerts) (Friday night) and [**Matinées**](/concerts) (Sunday morning). Performances range from electronic avant-garde to early music, embracing both vocal and instrumental territories. Detours into other live arts complement the season. The Center supports [**artists**](/people) in creating, performing, and disseminating their work, bridging international and local scenes.
