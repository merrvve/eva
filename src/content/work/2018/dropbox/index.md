At [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) I led design for an internal tool to coordinate millions of emails and in-product messages, helped ship a [presentation tool for creatives](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-plan-dropbox-professional), helped launch [time-based comments on audio and video files](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/time-based-commenting-audio-video), and pixel-hinted [rebranded](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/-dropbox-unveils-colorful-new-look-and-global-brand-campaign-foc) icons for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Also ran a [book club](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club).
