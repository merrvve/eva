I'm starting my first full-time job in three years, and I'm a little nervous about the adjustment from freelance. Hoping I still can find enough time and energy for personal projects. Attending class at the [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.study/) and increasingly interested in exploring the more artistic facets of building for the web. In August I'm moving in with my partner. I'm excited to make her breakfast.
