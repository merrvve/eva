I just passed two months at [Scribe](https://scribehow.com/) and things are going well. Margot and I are settling into our new apartment, which I adore for a multitude of reasons. I have become very interested in houseplantsâ€”I'm not yet fluent in their language but I'm learning a lot from them. Next week I'm going to attend [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) in Portland. Fortunate for travel, for stable work, for an apartment, for sunlight and cool summer nights. Lots of gratitude.
